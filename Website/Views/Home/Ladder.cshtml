	<h3>Ladder Structure</h3>
	<p>
		New games are started every 2 weeks. (Roughly every other Sunday, but bear in mind this is manually administered so may have to fit round my schedule a little)<br />
		Opponents are determined by ladder position - the top four active players are drawn together, and so on. (Until the ladder is inititalised by W1 games, opponents will be determined randomly).<br />
		The following four maps are used with equal frequency: Original, Fire and Ice Side 1, Loon Lakes, Fjords.<br />
		Games will be 4p, with the bottom 0-3 games being 3p as required.<br />
		Games are created with the following options: Mini expansion, Shipping bonus tile, Temple round scoring tile, Extra final scoring tile, Turn order determined by passing order, Fire & Ice expansion, Automatic email notifications.<br />
		The Time Limit will be a chess clock, 5d + 2d per round, grace period 8 hours. There is no deadline to complete games.<br />
		Roughly speaking, winning a game improves your ladder position by 25% (min 5 rungs), coming second improves your position by 10% (min 2 rungs), losing worsens your position by 5% (min 1 rung). More detailed algorithm below.
	</p>

	<h3>Determining Ladder Position - details</h3>
	<p>
		To determine ladder positions, the following algorithm is applied to each game in order of completion:<br />
		Anyone in the game who's not yet on the ladder, gets added at the bottom of the ladder, in order of finishing position (alphabetically in the case of a tie).<br />
		Everyone in the game gets their new ladder position calculated as follows (L is current ladder position, S is the score as determined by the table below).<br />
		For positive S: New L = Floor(Min(L *(1 - S/20), L - S)) <br />
		For negative S: New L = Ceiling(Max(L *(1 - S/20), L - S)) <br />
		If N players from the game receive the same new position, they are allocated positions L through L+ N - 1 ordered by position in the game and then alphabetically.<br />
		Ls are adjusted such that they are between 1 and (# of players on ladder).<br />
		Everyone else on the ladder gets shunted down/up rungs to accommodate the new positions.
